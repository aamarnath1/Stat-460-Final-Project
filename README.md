## A Comparison of the Ability of Classification Models: Predicting whether the Breast Cancer type is Malignant or Benign

### STAT 460: Applied Multivariate Analysis - Final Project

### Created by Alyaqadhan Alfahdi and Arya Amarnath



Overview
-------------------

The classification of breast cancer tumors into malignant or benign types is crucial for early intervention and treatment strategies. This study compares several machine learning models based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset to determine the most effective classifier. This project includes extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and rigorous model evaluation including logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines utilizing grid-search and cross-validation to acquire specialized hyperparameters.
